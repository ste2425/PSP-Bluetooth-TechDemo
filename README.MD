# PSP Bluetooth TechDemo [![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth-TechDemo/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg?branch=next)](https://github.com/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth-TechDemo/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml) ![Github latest downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth-TechDemo/total.svg)

PSP Bluetooth Tech Demo is a PSP application built using the unofficial PSPSDK and [glib2d (modded)](https://github.com/joel16/gLib2D). The code base for this project is based on the brilliant [CMFileManager](https://github.com/joel16/CMFileManager-PSP) project by *joel16*. It leverages the equally good SIO library from the [Operation Ditto](https://github.com/operation-ditto) project.

The purpose of this homebrew is to demonstrate the `PSP Bluetooth` project and how the PSP can interface with bluetooth controllers.

## Acknowledgements

The work ive done is just a thin layer ontop of work many other people have done, with lots of help from others.

* TokyoDrift - Originally created work that uses the SIO port to allow external controllers back around 2010. Since uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/unraze/PSXControllerToPSP)
* OPDitto project - A project that uses the SIO port to allow for a real second analog stick. Its SIO implementation has been extremly helpful to me. Repo [Here](https://github.com/Operation-DITTO)
* X41 - Shared with me an initial working SIO hello world app back when i could barely compile PSP code. This was invaluable in helping me get the hardware working right at the start of the project.
* PSP Homebrew Discord - Full of incredibly smart and helpful people too many to list individually. Without their help I'd never have managed to complete any of this.
